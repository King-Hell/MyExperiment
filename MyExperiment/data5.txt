There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream;go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
모모May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy? Always put yourself in others몶shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts the other person, too.
모모The happiest of people don몶t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for only they can appreciate the importance of people
모모who have touched their lives.Love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can몶t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
모모When you were born,you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.Live your life so that when you die,you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.
모모Please send this message to those people who mean something to you,to those who have touched your life in one way or another,to those who make you smile when you really need it,to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down,to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.And if you don몶t, don몶t worry,nothing bad will happen to you,you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone몶s day with this message.
As we know, American is regarded as a country living in the vehicle. From 1988 to 1998, California's population increased 18 percent while vehicle miles traveled grew by 21 percent overall. (Source: California Legislative Analyst's Office, May 2000). The number of registered vehicles has grown 28 percent in the last decade. (Source: California Chamber of Commerce, March 5, 1999). The average California household owns 1.78 vehicles, only fractionally higher than the national average. (Source: U.S. Census, Aug. 2001). So I think how to improve the standard of moving is important to the American government. We found the transportation system is so advanced.  How they can own these well transportation systems? After studying I found there are many lessons worthy us learning.

1.      The government paid more attention on it.

The government knew that good transportation system could dramatically increase our mobility, improve our economic competitiveness, improve the environment, and enhance the quality of our daily lives. Besides these, Transportation facilities and investments provide significant economic stimulus and job creation in the state. Transportation construction is a $160 billion-a-year industry in the U.S. It employs more than 1.6 million people. (Source: The American Road and Transportation Builders Association). So the government, no matter Federal or local, must invest on it. During the 1990s, the federal government put $156 billion in federal funds into highways, while spending a total of $45 billion on transit, bicycling, and walking facilities combined. Only in the fiscal 1994 President Clinton proposed spending $40.2 billion on transportation, including additional funds to bolster safety programs and fulfill his pledge to "rebuild America." That would be a 10% increase from what Congress appropriated for fiscal 1993, which ends Sept. 30. The administration is seeking the funds to carry out plans to accelerate investment in highways, airports and other infrastructure projects, Transportation Secretary. The federal government had allocated $4.5 billion in federal money to rebuild the transportation infrastructure destroyed by the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. The local government also paid money on the transportation.

From this chart we can see that California government plan to use $8285 millions on the transportation in 2005몱2006. That shares 71% of the total expenditures. The planning, development, and delivery of transportation services involves a multiplicity of local, regional, State, Federal and private sector agencies. No single agency at any level -- public or private-- is able to achieve its specific mission without the help of others.

2.      The government made full use of the policy to improve the transportation.

There are so many vehicles need parking in the downtown of Los Angeles city. It is difficulty for the government to invest too large money on it. So the government made full use of the policy that the air space can be sold. In the city rebuilding, they selected an area and cooperated with others to build a two-story parking lot. They collected the money by sold the air space and the funds. The government let other enterprise operate it. They can ask for fee that was lower than the average standard in order to sustain itself. Now the parking lots have been used for many years. It met the needs of the people. I think it is a good example worthy us learning.

3.      They utilized the high technology on the transportation.

They made use of the computer on the transportation. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) was a good example. BRT makes use of sleek high-tech vehicles resembling a hybrid bus/train that can travel on specially designed "guide ways" as well as regular roads. A BRT vehicle would be able to carry passengers over a dedicated right-of-way, such as an old railroad line, and then wheel through city centers and neighborhoods picking up riders. As BRT is envisioned, intersections would be realigned with dedicated bus lanes, and a BRT driver could signal the traffic light from a short distance away and trigger a green light to let the commuters through ahead of the cars. BRT systems are already operating successfully worldwide and in 14 cities in the United States including Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, Hartford, Miami, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles.

It can reduce actual traffic by 5 to 8 percent.

4.      They have a long term plan on it.

In 1993,California had made a long term Transportation. It provided direction for planning, developing, operating, and maintaining California몶s transportation system.  This State long-range transportation plan is required by the federal Inter modes Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, and was developed under SB 1435 (Chapter 1177, 1992 Statutes) and Governor몶s Executive Order W-36-92.  It has been developed by the California Department of Transportation in cooperation with other state agencies and departments, local governments, and interested members of the public and the private sector. Its policy focus on transportation and economic development, transportation system safety, maintenance and enhancement, and environmental protection remains the same.  The plan recommends the convening of a special commission to review the future of transportation in California; the developing of a State goods movement strategy; and the refining of the State몶s role in non-highway transportation modes. The CTP includes a review of California몶s transportation system and the major policies and objectives for California몶s future transportation system. Actions are identified under each objective, for near-term implementation or the for the development of legislation, process or consensus, by the 

transportation community. It strides to provide California a modern, balanced, integrated multimode transportation system for the twenty-first century.

5.      NPO made more contributions to it.

There are many NPO (Nonprofit Organization) supply the service to the transportation in the US. The famous one is AAA (American Automobile Association). On March 4, 1902, nine motor clubs met in Chicago to form the American Automobile Association. After one hundred years of actively representing the interests of motorists and other travelers, AAA is currently nearly 45 million members strong. From Emergency Road Service to approved auto repair facilities, from the school safety patrol to driver education programs, from special cruise and tour packages to member discounts around the world, they stand behind our commitment to provide safety, security and peace of mind. As AAA continues to incorporate the latest technology including Internet access to products and services, telemetric capabilities, stored value cards and more, they enter the future with a vigorous commitment to serve our members.

I feel that the America transportation is good. But the government and the citizens did not think so. They regarded it as a one of the serious problems they must work hard to resolve. I do believe that it would be better in the future.
